# newCFile

This script can be run in the linux/bash terminal to create a new file with a basic main function outline for C.
You pass in the file name including the .c ending when calling the ./newC.py <filename>.c
This will create and save a new C file in your directory along with opening it with:

#include <stdio.h>

/*
*
*/
int main() {

return 0;
}

ENJOY!
